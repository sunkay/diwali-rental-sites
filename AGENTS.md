Guidelines for anyone making changes to this repository.

- Build a static website (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS only).
- No frameworks, no build tools unless absolutely needed.
- Keep all configuration values in one file (form link, email, phone).
- Every page must have a "Request to Book" button.
- Add accessibility basics (alt text, reasonable contrast).
- Keep copy short and simple.
- Always propose a plan before large changes.
